# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Architecture

I literally used my daughter's crayon to make my conceptual napkin design for Cruddur app:

## Overview

As a cloud engineering enthusiast, I find the value of a logic diagram and conceptual napkin design to be invaluable when working with various stakeholders on a project. These diagrams help to provide a clear visual representation of the architecture, which makes it easier for everyone to understand the system, irrespective of their background (technical/non-technical).

For the logic/conceptual diagram, I map out the various components, including the frontend, backend, databases, and common services. This allows me to see the big picture and identify any potential areas for improvement.

Using the logic diagram in this project journal helps with communication and collaboration among the team. By providing a clear and visual representation of the system.

### Cruddur logical design

This was produced using Lucid chart.
